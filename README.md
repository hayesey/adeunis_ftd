# adeunis_ftd

This is a simple payload decoder example for the Adeunis LoRaWAN Field Test Device.

It can be used with The Things Network v2 (TTN) only at this time.

**Note:** this is designed for testing purposes only, I take no responsibility for anyone using this getting missing or incorrect data!

## The Things Network V2 Instructions

Simply copy and paste the code from decoder.js into the Payload Formats tab in your TTN application. Into the decoder box, replacing anything already in there.
